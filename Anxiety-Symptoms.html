			<h2>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</h2>

			<h2>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h2>

			<p>People with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) display excessive anxiety or worry, most days for at least 6 months, about a number of things such as personal health, work, social interactions, and everyday routine life circumstances. The fear and anxiety can cause significant problems in areas of their life, such as social interactions, school, and work.
			</p>

			<p>Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms include:</p>

			<ul> 

			<li>Feeling restless, wound-up, or on-edge</li>
			<li>Being easily fatigued</li>
			<li>Having difficulty concentrating; mind going blank</li>
			<li>Being irritable</li>
			<li>Having muscle tension</li>
			<li>Difficulty controlling feelings of worry</li>
			<li>Having sleep problems, such as difficulty falling or   staying asleep, restlessness, or unsatisfying sleep </li>
			</ul>


			<h2>Panic Disorder</h2>

			<p>People with panic disorder have recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that come on quickly and reach their peak within minutes. Attacks can occur unexpectedly or can be brought on by a trigger, such as a feared object or situation.
			</p>

			<p>During a panic attack, people may experience:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Heart palpitations, a pounding heartbeat, or an accelerated heartrate</li>	
			<li>Sweating </li>
			<li>Trembling or shaking </li>
			<li>Sensations of shortness of breath, smothering, or choking </li>
			<li>Feelings of impending doom </li>
			<li>Feelings of being out of control </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p> People with panic disorder often worry about when the next attack will happen and actively try to prevent future attacks by avoiding places, situations, or behaviors they associate with panic attacks. Worry about panic attacks, and the effort spent trying to avoid attacks, cause significant problems in various areas of the personâ€™s life, including the development of agoraphobia.
