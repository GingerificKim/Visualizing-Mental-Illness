			<h2>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</h2>

			<p>People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both. These symptoms can interfere with all aspects of life, such as work, school, and personal relationships.</p> 

			<p><b>Obsessions</b> are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. Common symptoms include:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Fear of germs or contamination</li>
			<li>Unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, or harm</li>
			<li>Aggressive thoughts towards others or self</li>
			<li>Having things symmetrical or in a perfect order</li>
			</ul>	

			<p> <b>Compulsions</b> are repetitive behaviors that a person with OCD feels the urge to do in response to an obsessive thought. Common compulsions include:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing</li>
			<li>Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way</li>
			<li>Repeatedly checking on things, such asrepeatedly checking to see if the door is locked or that the oven is off</li>
			<li>Compulsive counting</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Not all rituals or habits are compulsions. Everyone double checks things sometimes. But a person with OCD generally:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Can't control his or her thoughts or behaviors, even when those thoughts or behaviors are recognized as excessive</li>
			<li>Spends at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors</li>
			<li>Doesn’t get pleasure when performing the behaviors or rituals, but may feel brief relief from the anxiety the thoughts cause</li>
			<li> Experiences significant problems in their daily life due to these thoughts or behaviors</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Symptoms may come and go, ease over time, or worsen. People with OCD may try to help themselves by avoiding situations that trigger their obsessions, or they may use alcohol or drugs to calm themselves. </p>

			<p>Although most adults with OCD recognize that what they are doing doesn’t make sense, some adults and most children may not realize that their behavior is out of the ordinary. Parents or teachers typically recognize OCD symptoms in children.</p>

			<p>If you think you have OCD, talk to your doctor about your symptoms. If left untreated, OCD can interfere in all aspects of life.</p>
